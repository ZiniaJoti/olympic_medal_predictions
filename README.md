# olympic_medal_predictions
# Overview
Beginner level ML project to predict the number of medals for a country. Followed Dataquest's YT video.
Building Machine Learning model using Python and Jupyter
Steps include: 
  1. Read and explore the dataset
  2. Reshape the data
  3. Clean Data
  4. Split Data into train and test sets
  5. Train Data using the past years data set(train dataset)
  6. Use Linear Regression Model
  7. Predict the model on test data set
  8. Use Error Metrics
# Code
Main code: machine_learning_project.ipynb

# Used setup
Python 3.7.3 
Jupyter Notebook
**Libraries:**
  1. pandas
  2. numpy
  3. scikit-learn
  4. seaborn

# Data
I will be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on [Kaggle]
But summerised by Vikas Paruchuri. You can find the data preparation code in this [link].
